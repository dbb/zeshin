## Description

**Zeshin** is a tool to help you manage your zsh configuration on different
machines using git. It is named after [the Japanese
painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeshin).

## Usage

Prerequisites: must have an active Github account and a valid `~/.gitconfig`.

First, dowload the script and add it to your `$PATH`. Then check the `files`
variable at the beginning of the script to make sure everything you want to
track is there, and run `zeshin init` to create a Github repo called `myzsh`.

Let's say you're on a new machine and want to set up your shell. Just run
`zeshin dl` and log out. Done.
